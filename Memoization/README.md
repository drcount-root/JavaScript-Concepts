## Memoization

Memoization is a specific form of Caching, that involves caching that returns value based on it's parameters. And if the parameter of the function doesn't change then it's memoized (or it uses the cached value).

Memoization is a technique for optimizing the performance of a function by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

#### Example:

Fibonacci Series, factorial of a number, makes recursive algorithms efficient.
