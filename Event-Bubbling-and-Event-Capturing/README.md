# Event, Event Bubbling, Capturing aka Trickling in Javascript

## Event

The Event interface represents an event/signal which takes place in the DOM. An event can be triggered by the user action e.g. clicking the mouse button or tapping keyboard, or generated by APIs to represent the progress of an asynchronous task.

## Event handlers

To react on events we can assign a handler â€“ a function that runs in case of an event.

These are 2 ways of event propagation in the DOM tree.
