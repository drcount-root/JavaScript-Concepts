## Promise

A promise is simply a placeholder for an asynchronous task which is yet to be completed.

Promise is an object that represents the completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.

When you define a promise object in your script, instead of returning a value immediately, it returns a promise.

A promise in JavaScript is asynchronous, meaning it takes time to resolve or finish.
