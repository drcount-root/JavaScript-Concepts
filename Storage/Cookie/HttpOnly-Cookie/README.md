## What is an HttpOnly Cookie?

> An HttpOnly Cookie is a tag added to a browser cookie that prevents client-side scripts from accessing data. It provides a gate that prevents the specialized cookie from being accessed by anything other than the server.  Using the HttpOnly tag when generating a cookie helps mitigate the risk of client-side scripts accessing the protected cookie, thus making these cookies more secure.
