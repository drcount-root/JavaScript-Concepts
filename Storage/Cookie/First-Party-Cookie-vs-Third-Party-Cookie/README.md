## First Party Cookie vs Third Party Cookie

> **First-party cookies** are cookies that are set by the website you are visiting. They are usually used to keep track of your preferences on the site, as well as to remember things like your login information.

> **Third-party cookies**, on the other hand, are cookies that are set by a domain other than the one you are visiting. These cookies are often used for things like tracking your behavior across different websites, or serving targeted advertisements to you. Some people view third-party cookies as a privacy concern, because they allow other companies to track your online activity.
