# Cookies

### What is Cookie?

> Cookies are pieces of data, normally stored in small text files sent by the web-server using the response HTTP-header to the user's browser, and are stored on the user's device. Then, the browser automatically adds them to (almost) every request to the same domain using the Cookie HTTP-header. Cookies are designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember stateful information or to record the user’s browsing activity. It is used to remember information about the user's interactions with a website, such as login status, preferences (such as your preferred language and other settings), and shopping cart items. When the user visits the website again, the browser sends the cookie back to the server. This allows the server to retrieve the information stored in the cookie and use it to customize the user's experience or track their activity on the website. This can make it easier for you to use the site the next time you visit, because your preferences will be remembered. Cookies can also be used to track your online behavior and to serve you targeted advertisements.

### Reason of using Cookies

> Cookies also allow you to login on one page, then move around to other pages and remain logged in. They allow you to set preferences for the display of a page, and for those preferences to be remembered the next time you return.

> Cookies are used for a wide variety of purposes, such as remembering user preferences, tracking website usage, and personalizing advertising.

> Think about an e-commerce store. When you add something to your cart and then move to another page, the product is still in the cart. It is a cookie that allows the website to do this.

> Cookies can be incredibly useful, they allow modern websites to meet people’s expectations of personalization and rich interactive functionality.

> Cookies can also be used to track the pages you visit from site to site, which allows advertisers to track your interests and behaviors. Then, when you land on a site that shows one of their advertisements, they can tailor it to those interests, which is known as ‘behavioral advertising’.

> However, they can also be used to manipulate your web experience in ways you might not expect or approve. Cookies could be used to benefit a business or organization that you have never had any direct contact with, or perhaps heard of.

### 3 Types of Cookies:

> 1. **Session Cookies** : These cookies are temporary and are deleted when the user closes the web browser. They are used to store information that is needed only for the duration of the user's visit to a website.
> 2. **Persistent Cookies** : These cookies are stored on the user's device for a longer period of time, even after the web browser is closed. They are used to remember information about the user across multiple visits to a website, such as login status or preferences.
> 3. **Third-Party Cookies** : Third-party cookies are set by a domain other than the one the user is visiting, and are often used for tracking and advertising purposes.

### Secure Cookies:

> Secure Cookies are a type of cookie that is transmitted over a secure connection (usually HTTPS). They are used to store sensitive information, such as financial data, that needs to be protected from being intercepted by third parties.
> There are 2 main types of secure cookies:
>
> 1. **HttpOnly secure cookies**: These cookies can only be accessed by the server and are not accessible to client-side scripts. They are stored in the user's browser, but can only be sent back to the server over a secure connection.
>
> 2. **Same-site cookies**: These cookies are used to prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. They are stored in the user's browser and are only sent to the server when the user visits the site that set the cookie. This means that they are not sent along with requests to other sites, which helps to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.

> Secure cookies are an important security measure that helps to protect the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information transmitted over the internet. They are often used in conjunction with other security measures, such as encryption and authentication, to provide a high level of protection for online transactions and other sensitive activities.

### How long can a Cookie last?

> The duration of a cookie can be set when the cookie is created. By default, the cookie is destroyed when the current browser window is closed, but it can be made to persist for a length of time after the page is closed.

> Some cookies are **session cookies**, which means they only exist when your browser is open and are automatically deleted when you close your browser or quit the app.

> Other cookies are **persistent cookies**, meaning they survive after your browser or app is closed and can be used by websites or apps to recognize your computer when you re-open your browser or app later. To let cookies survive a browser close, we can set either the `expires` or `max-age` option.

### What Information is Stored in a Cookie?

> Information stored in a cookie can vary from your preferred language to location. Cookies often store your settings for a website. When you return to the site, the browser sends back the cookies that belong to the site. This allows the site to present you with information customized to fit your needs.

> Cookies can store a wide range of information, including personally identifiable information (such as your name, home address, email address, or telephone number).

<br>

### Which Cookies are Advertising Cookies?

> These cookies are almost always third-party, persistent cookies. This means that the cookies can follow the user as they visit other websites.

<br>

### What is a Tracking Cookie?

> A tracking cookie is a sample of text dropped onto a browser while viewing a website. This text collects data from a user such as their activity on a website, browsing history, geographic location, purchase trends, and more.

> What makes a tracking cookie unique is that it can follow a user across multiple sites or services and continue to stack data. The information gathered is often used for direct marketing purposes such as targeted ads, but tracking cookies do carry criticism as some fear the amount of data collected can be intrusive.

> **Example**:
> An example of a tracking cookie is one set by Facebook. When you visit and log into Facebook, it puts a tracking cookie on your browser. This means every time you visit a site that has Facebook integrated, that site will be able to determine information such as if you have a Facebook account or not.
